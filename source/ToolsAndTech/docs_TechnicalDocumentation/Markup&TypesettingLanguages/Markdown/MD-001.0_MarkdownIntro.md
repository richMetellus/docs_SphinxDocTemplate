# Introduction to Markdown

**Markdown**

- is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004.
- It allows you to format plain text using simple syntax, which is then
  converted to HTML or other formats.

- is widely used for documentation (e.g., GitHub READMEs),
  forums (e.g., Reddit), note-taking apps (e.g., Obsidian),
  and static site generators (e.g., Jekyll, Hugo).
