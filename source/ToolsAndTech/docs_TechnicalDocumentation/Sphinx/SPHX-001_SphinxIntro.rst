Sphinx Intro 
##############

Sphinx 

* is a open-source, python project that is based on Docutils (another open-source 
  python project)

  Since it is based on Docutils text processing system, it inherits
    
  * the ability to convert plaintext documentation into useful formats such as 
    HTML, XML, LaTeX, man-pages, OpenDocument.
  
  * the built-in rST parser of docutils,
  * the extensible nature of reStructuredText and Docutils. (builders, parsers, 
    markup extension, etc ...)
